## Web Maps
What’s a web map? Esri, the company behind ArcGIS and ArcGIS Online, describes a web map as “an interactive display of geographic information that you can use to tell stories and answer questions” (source: [Web maps](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-web-map.htm)).

### Creating a New Map
Click **Map** in the top level menu of your ArcGIS Online homepage to create a new map. From there, you will be taken to a new blank map for you to make your own!

*Note: for the purposes of this tutorial, we will use Map Viewer Classic, which allows us to upload data by file. The new Map Viewer does not have this feature yet. Click “Open in Map Viewer Classic” at the top right of the map menu to switch over.*

### Customizing Your Map’s Appearance
You can customize the way your map looks by clicking **Basemap** in the top level menu of the map view, and then selecting your chosen basemap. You can change this at any time, so can come back and make edits for the best base map for your purposes once your data has been added to the map.

> Let’s reflect: how might different basemaps influence a viewer’s experience of a digital map?

### Saving Your Map
Click the **Save** button on the top level menu of the map view, then click **Save As** to save a new map or a new copy of an existing map: you will be prompted to give your new map a title and tags (required, but you can choose any you would like), and to add a summary, if desired. If you are working with a pre-existing map, just click *Save* to keep saving it to the same place – *make sure to do this regularly while you are working so your changes are saved*.

### Returning to an Existing Map
Click *Content* in the top level menu (available when you click the *Home* button if you are currently viewing a map or other content) to see all your saved content and return to an existing map. Click the title of an existing map, then click the *Open in Map Viewer* button (top right) to continue editing.
