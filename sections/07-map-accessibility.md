# Map Accessibility
What is web accessibility? “Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.” (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility)).

## Important Accessibility Considerations
As you create your map, keep accessibility at the forefront of your mind:
* be careful in your use of color and ensure appropriate color contrasts and differentiation (basemap, layer colors…)
* consider how you can avoid using color alone to convey meaning: vary labels and color, utilize different shapes, change both size and color value of the same shape (source: [“Improving Accessibility with ArcGIS Online Web Mapping Apps”](https://www.doi.gov/ocio/section508/video3) presentation from Esri)
* be thoughtful about your text content (pop-ups, map descriptions, and more): break up walls of text, ensure appropriate typeface and font size when you are customizing, provide links that make sense out of context (i.e., no “click here”)

## Check Your Work
You can use these resources to check your work:
* check color contrasts with WebAIM’s [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
* check accessible color selection with Toptal’s [Colorblind Web Page Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter), the [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) software, or the [Colorblindly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblindly/floniaahmccleoclneebhhmnjgdfijgg?hl=en) Chrome extension

> Let’s reflect: what choices do you make as map creators that impact the accessibility of your maps for your viewers? What are some concrete examples of accessible features on a web map? What else do you need to keep in mind?
