# Adding Additional Layers

You can add more layers to your map – layers created by your classmates that have been added to the course group, and even data layers added to ArcGIS Online by other users!

Simply click the **Layers** button in the left-hand menu and then click the **Add** button at the bottom of your list of layers. From the dropdown at the top you can select:
* **My groups** to search for content shared in your course group (and other groups)
* **Living Atlas** to search for data layers that have been vetted by Esri, the maker of ArcGIS Online – many of these are demographic data layers (like census data)
* **ArcGIS Online** to search all of what has been shared publicly in ArcGIS Online

You can then use the search bar to look for more specific layers. For example, you can search Living Atlas for demographic data, such as average household income or average household spending in Spain.

Click the **+ Add** button at the bottom right of the layer to add it to your map.

You may need to rearrange the order of your layers by dragging and dropping them in the left-hand layer pane so that your Spanish detective novel points don't disappear under the layer of demographic data you have added.

You can customize the styling, properties, and pop-ups of your newly added layer the same way you can a layer of your own.
