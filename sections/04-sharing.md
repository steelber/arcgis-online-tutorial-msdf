# Sharing Your Map
There are ways to directly share your map with others if you want to. You can do this in a couple of different ways, depending on your needs. There are several sharing levels:
* owner: visible only to you, the creator
* organization: visible to all members in our organization, Grinnell College
* everyone (public): visible to the wider community outside of Grinnell College

You can very easily a pull an ArcGIS Online map into a StoryMap to provide narrative and context relating to your map. You will still want your map sharing levels to be set to whatever sharing level your StoryMap will be.

It is also possible to create a “shared update” group for sharing, which allows multiple people to work on the same map at once (similar to the collaborative editing features in Office 365). You are not able to create “shared update” groups on your own: this must be done by an admin. You can make this request by putting in an ITS Help Desk ticket.

To be able to embed your map on an external website, you need to make sure it is set to the “public” sharing setting. Once you have done so, you can click the Embed in Website button to customize your embed settings. Your map does not need to be shared publicly to be shared more widely as a web app – more on that below.
