# Sharing Your Content
A shared update group has been created for your class, which means that you can share your content to the group so your classmates can see it (and in the case of hosted feature layers, use it in your maps!) and collaborate with you on maps and StoryMaps. You just need to make sure to share your hosted feature layers, maps, and other content to the course group.

You'll also want to share your maps and content beyond the course group, so that they're visible in the StoryMaps and other content that you create.

There are several sharing levels:
* owner: visible only to you, the creator
* organization: visible to all members in our organization, Grinnell College
* everyone (public): visible to the wider community outside of Grinnell College
* group level sharing: an item can be shared both within a group and organizationally/publicly – group sharing just makes sure your group members can find it (and edit it if needed, in the case of shared update groups)

## Sharing Your Hosted Feature Layer
You'll want to make sure to share your hosted feature layer with the rest of the class so others can use it in their maps. Eventually, your feature layer will need to be public or organizationally visible so that it can be viewed by others as needed.

1. From the ArcGIS Online homepage, click **Content** in the menu at the top.
2. Click the title of your hosted feature layer.
3. In the menu of option buttons on the right, click **Share** (at the bottom).
4. In the pop-up box that appears, choose whether to share your layer organizationally or publicly.
5. Then click the **Edit group sharing** button to share it to the course group.
6. Select the course group in the list of groups that appears, then click the **OK** button at the bottom right.
7. Click the **Save** button to Save your changes.

## Sharing Your Map
You will also want to share your maps, both to the course group and organizationally or publicly so that others can view them.

You can very easily a pull an ArcGIS Online map into a StoryMap to provide narrative and context relating to your map. You will still want your map sharing levels to be set to whatever sharing level your StoryMap will be, whether it is organizational or public.

1. From the ArcGIS Online homepage, click **Content** in the menu at the top.
2. Click into your map.
3. Click **Share** (arrow coming out of a box icon) in the left-hand menu of options.
4. In the pop-up box that appears, choose whether to share your layer organizationally or publicly.
5. Then click the **Edit group sharing** button to share it to the course group.
6. Select the course group in the list of groups that appears, then click the **OK** button at the bottom right.
7. Click the **Save** button to Save your changes.
