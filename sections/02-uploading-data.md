# Uploading Data as a Hosted Feature Layer
What's a hosted feature layer? ArcGIS Online allows you to publish a layer (a collection of specific geographic data to be mapped) directly to ArcGIS as its own independent piece of content, so it can be pulled into multiple maps, shared with others, and updated as needed.

## Creating a Hosted Feature Layer
You will upload your spreadsheet of detective novel location data to ArcGIS Online as a hosted feature layer, so that you can pull it into your map and share it with your classmates.

Make sure your data spreadsheet is ready to upload: once it is uploaded to ArcGIS Online, you can change and update the data itself as needed, but you will not be able to change the data structure (spreadsheet headings and categories) without needing to upload a new hosted feature layer.

1. Export your spreadsheet data file as a **CSV**.
** If using Excel in the browser, you will need to download your file and convert it from the Excel software application on a computer (as Offcie365 does not let you save as a CSV): go to File > Save As, and select CSV/Comma Separated Values from the dropdown.
2. Make sure your data is as clean as possible: no duplicate header fields, no extraneous information, etc.
3. Make sure your filename does not have any spaces or special characters in it.
4. Log in to ArcGIS Online at https://grinnell.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html and click **Content** in the navigation menu at the top.
5. Click **+New item** in the top left-hand corner.
6. Drag and drop your file into the box at the top of the "New item" pop-up.
7. Select the option to *create a hosted feature layer or table* as you add your file.
8. Review the field types and make sure your latitude and longitude coordinates are recognized as *Double* in the field type dropdown, then click *Next*.
9. Make sure your latitude and longitude fields are correctly recognized as such, then click *Next*.
10. Give your file a title, tags, and summary as needed, then click *Save*.
11. Once the file finishes uploading, your hosted feature layer will load on your screen!

FYI: once you have uploaded an item, you cannot upload another item with the same name.

## Updating a Hosted Feature Layer
You can update your hosted feature layer if you add more data or make corrections. Since we are not using unique IDs, you will need to overwrite your entire layer to update it.

1. From within ArcGIS Online, click **Content** in the top-level menu.
2. Click into the title of your hosted feature layer.
3. Click the **Update** button in the menu on the right.
4. Choose the **Overwrite entire feature layer** option.
5. Upload your corrected data file – please note that the file name of the updated layer needs to be the same as the name of the file originally uploaded to ArcGIS Online.
7. Save and update the data.

FYI the field names in the updated layer need to be the same the names of the fields in the file originally uploaded to ArcGIS Online (see Data tab). No new fields will be accepted.
