# Customizing Pop-Ups
What is a pop-up? A pop-up is the box of descriptive information that appears when a map viewer clicks on a point or feature on a map.

## Pop-Up Configuration

You can configure the pop-ups that appear when a viewer clicks on your data points. By default, they show a table with all of the information from that point’s row in your spreadsheet – but some or most of this information may not be needed depending on what you are trying to showcase with your map.

By default, what appears is a **Fields list** of all your point's data fields: you can click into this to customize which fields appear.

You can click the **+ Add content** button at the bottom to customize the content that appears. You can add a **Text** field and customize the text that appears by pulling in specific fields using curly brackets, such as \{Field Name\}.

You can even pull images and charts into your pop-up, though these need to be created based on your data fields (so a link to an image hosted elsewhere would need to appear in the spreadsheet as a field).

Don’t forget to click the **OK** button at the bottom of the pane when you’re done customizing your pop-up, to save your changes.

> Let’s reflect: how do external map elements like this pop-up influence the viewing experience? How do you think they could or should be used most effectively?
