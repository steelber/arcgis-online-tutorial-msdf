## What Is ArcGIS Online?
ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based online mapping software that allows you to create complex digital maps for data analysis, as well as easily share them with others. ArcGIS Online replicates many of the functions of the ArcGIS software application, though it is not quite as powerful.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use ArcGIS Online by mapping historical data from the [Iowa Township Project](https://dasil.sites.grinnell.edu/2019/04/land-census-and-digital-humanities-the-iowa-township-project/).

### Logging In
Everyone at Grinnell has access to ArcGIS Online through the College. You can access your account by logging in with your Grinnell College credentials at https://grinnell.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html. It is used in the browser, so you do not need to download anything special onto your computer.

### Downloading Data
Download the [dataset](/Grinnell_1900_Geocoding_Result_Tidied.csv) for this tutorial from this repository. You’ll upload this data into ArcGIS Online in order to map and analyze it. This dataset is a CSV file that contains Town of Grinnell census data from 1900, cleaned and formatted for use. You can look at the [Iowa Townships Data Codebook](/2019-Codebook-Iowa-Townships-Data-Set.pdf) to learn more about what the different abbreviations in the dataset mean.

Spatial data can take many forms: for the purposes of this walkthrough, we are using a spreadsheet with location information in some of the columns (in this case, latitude and longitude). Another file format option for spatial data is shapefiles. Shapefiles are a file format for storing geographical location and attribute information data, and they are actually made up of a grouping of individual files, compressed into a single .zip file that is uploaded all at once to ArcGIS Online. You can play around with some spatial data in shapefile format in the optional Going Further section of this tutorial.

> Let’s reflect! Download the dataset CSV, look through it, and think about what you see…
> * What do you notice about this data?
> * What questions do you think this dataset might help to answer, if visualized on a map?
